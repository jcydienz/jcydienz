# About Me

- I've been programming for 9 years, I learned on ROBLOX messing around with free-models - and then I went to university for programming where I learned Python, and JavaScript which led me to learn Typescript myself.
- I've moved to four different countries in my lifetime, and have visited 15 countries looking to expand that soon. I currently reside in the United Kingdom
- I can speak English & Polish.

# Portfolio
